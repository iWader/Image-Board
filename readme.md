## Image Board

Image board is a website for displaying images in a masonry-style storyboard.

I created this as a means of sharing images from MCM Expo Birmingham in a creative way.

Currently the sites functionality is very limited as I only intend for myself to be able to upload and manage images, however if the interest is there I may turn this into more of a social platform as part of a pet project
